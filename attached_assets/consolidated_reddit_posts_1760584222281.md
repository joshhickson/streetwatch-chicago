# PSA: Please read before reporting ICE/Military sightings in Chicago

Hey everyone. Understandably, tensions are high right now for many of us in the windy city, and this weekend along with the coming weeks promise to be chaotic and confusing due to the increase in ICE activity and possible military/national guard presence.

When reporting ICE or military activity, it's important to include actionable information that people can use to help keep themselves and others safe.

The SALUTE method is used by the military to provide a detailed description of opposing forces, which we can apply here. SALUTE is an acronym for SIZE, ACTIVITY, LOCATION, UNIFORM, TIME, and EQUIPMENT. Here is a summary of what a SALUTE Report entails and the type of information that will be helpful when posting ICE or NG sightings in Chicago.

* **SIZE**: Include the number of individuals, vehicles, or assets present in the observed area.
* **ACTIVITY**: Describe the actions and behavior of the observed group/individuals.
* **LOCATION**: Provide precise detailed description of the activity’s location.
* **UNIFORM**: Identify the affiliation or group to which the observed entity belongs.
* **TIME**: Record the date and time of the observation.
* **EQUIPMENT**: List the equipment, weaponry, or tools associated with the observed group.

If you believe you are witnessing ICE activity, please call [The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant &amp; Refugee Rights](https://www.icirr.org/)' 24-Hour Family Support Hotline at 1-855-HELP-MY-FAMILY (1-855-435-7693) to report it.

If you find yourself interacting with an ICE officer in any location including your workplace, or out in the community, remember that you:

* Have the right to remain silent when questioned or arrested by immigration officers
* Should remain calm and keep your hands where the officer can see them
* DO NOT:
   * discuss your immigration or citizenship status with the police, immigration agents, or other officials 
   * sign anything you do not understand. You should state that you wish to speak with an attorney

If an officer knocks on your door at home: Do NOT open the door. Teach your children not to open the door.

* ICE officers must have a warrant signed by a judge to enter your home. ICE “warrants” are not signed by judges; they are ICE forms signed by ICE officers and they do not grant authority to enter your home without your consent

If you are outdoors and think you see immigration officers nearby:

* Move to a safe indoor space
* If you are a U.S. citizen and feel safe to do so, record the activity with your phone or write down any relevant information about what you witness—ALWAYS being careful to not interfere or otherwise obstruct the operation

DO NOT

* Post unverified information on social media
* Interfere with the investigation or otherwise put yourself in harm’s way

├─ This is a good example of a not so good ICE report ⏤ by *amyphetamine* (↑ 80/ ↓ 0)
├── Agreed. Where is a better place to talk about it? I couldn’t leave my students to get the proper SALUTE information to write a report about their actions. There were 7 vehicles with ICE agents in them. I watched out of my classroom window as security guards and admin assessed the situation. It’s not being reported in the local news. Sorry it didn’t meet the SALUTE parameters, but it’s still valid information, just not for this thread. ⏤ by *hb2400* (↑ 10/ ↓ 0)
├─── I still don't think you get it. No location, no time, no description of what the agents looked like or what they were doing. Basically, no one can do anything with the limited information you've provided. ⏤ by *Pettifoggerist* (↑ 26/ ↓ 0)

##### How does someone potentially running/hiding from a raid have time to gather that much info to report? “Potential ICE raid in the Loop! Can someone confirm?” That would be valid to alert others (among whom could be more investigators &amp; those trying to be safe from the raid) ⏤ by *Competitive-Path-507* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─ Of course personal safety comes first, and yes, asking for someone else to confirm is valid too. The issue is folks reporting incorrect assumptions as fact, which this helps to avoid. ⏤ by *amyphetamine* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

##### ..I guess 53 people shot in two days ain’t worth the same anger and protest? Or is it’s not fitting some narrative? ⏤ by *KremCollective* (↑ -10/ ↓ 0)
├─ You clearly lack perspective, or you are being willfully ignorant. 

53 people in a sea of millions of residents is literally unnoticeable. Statistically, the average person living their entire life in Chicago is unlikely to ever be the victim of any kind of violent crime. 

53 people in a city of 200? Yeah that would be a nightmare situation. 53 people on the entire planet? Would that also require sending in the army? Lol

And let's be real. The crime problems are almost entire gang on gang related crimes on the west and south sides, and we all know that ICE and the NG won't be setting foot there. They will be downtown and on the Northside just to provoke a situation in an otherwise peaceful environment. Any crime stat drops while they are here are entirely temporary and not solving a single long term issue that leads to those crimes. ⏤ by *DontCountToday* (↑ -2/ ↓ 0)
├── 53 people is still people, I grew up on the south side, shot at on 2 different occasions and left just last year. Everyone down south is pleading for safety but nobody up north or the mayor seems to give a fuck. Speak to people down south and a lot of people are praising the guard and the police to step up and do something. ⏤ by *KremCollective* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
├─── The guard won't help any of them. They aren't even allowed to. ⏤ by *DontCountToday* (↑ 4/ ↓ 0)
├─── 1 death is tragic. So is 53, but that's not the point. More violence by the state won't reduce those numbers; it will only make for more bodies. Making brown skinned people live even more in fear won't reduce the crime rate. 
We need to see a lot more change in social policy and a reduction in the poverty rate if we want to see crime rates drop. 
And while all 53 of those deaths are tragic, that is not an outstanding number of deaths per capita when compared to the rest of the US. ⏤ by *MrBobaFett* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├─── Send the guard down there ⏤ by *Fresh_Dot3413* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
├── &gt;Statistically, the average person living their entire life in Chicago is unlikely to ever be the victim of any kind of violent crime.

If you extend it to the entire life, and you just take Chicago as a whole as an individual unit, you have something like 35%-40% chance of being a victim of violent crime in Chicago.

It's still rare, but statistically over a full lifetime, 1 in 3 isn't that rare. ⏤ by *SomeNoveltyAccount* (↑ -3/ ↓ 0)
├─── Yes, and here in real life, if you are not involved in a gang or closely surrounded by those who are, your chances are much, much lower. ⏤ by *DontCountToday* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
├──── Absolutely, that's why I made sure to clarify "take Chicago as a whole as an individual unit".

##### Not gonna lie, Im not a fan of ICE but using the SALUTE report that the military does is veeeeery corny….. ⏤ by *Crafty-Analysis-1468* (↑ -34/ ↓ 0)
├─ Who cares if it's corny. Being effective is more important than not being corny and this is a proven effective method to remember what information to gather to report.  
  
A good chunk of the public and this administration needs to dillusion itself with the idea that the most effective military is the "coolest" or "most macho" military. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 9/ ↓ 0)

├─ Which report format would you prefer? ⏤ by *vapemyashes* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
├── I mean…does it not seem just kinda weird to use a US military reporting system when you know the US military is on ICE’s side? And also, which is gonna get me really hated here but….as much as I also dont like ICE, dont any of you think this is maybe going a little too far?….. They’re not the Gestapo…. and whats your end goal? Are people gonna start treating law enforcement like enemy soldiers and start…..you know….. 💥🔫? I am not one to support a ideology if were just gonna go to the most extreme side of said ideology. ⏤ by *Crafty-Analysis-1468* (↑ -14/ ↓ 0)
├─── Idk it’s a tool that works. I don’t think any of us should speak for the members of the us military. They will probably have to decide for themselves how they interpret their oath and responsibilities. ICE isn’t them tho. So that’s besides the point. I think it’s fair to use a tool that works to protect your family and neighbors from a masked threat operating outside of any jurisdiction. You’re bringing the pew pew to this thread, why? ⏤ by *vapemyashes* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)
├─── How is ICE different from the Gestopo? Other than location. Please educate us. To answer your question: Yes. This whole thing has gone too far. No one has done much to stop This. In fact more doors have been opened to keep This growing and expanding. This was initially supposed to be about ushering in a new golden age of prosperity for our country. Instead This is about a few people getting revenge, spreading fear, expressing jealousy, hate, and lashing out at anybody who hasn't kept their place under foot. Our ideology is supposed to be about Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness so that we can be an example of strength and prosperity to the rest of the world. Not.... This.

##### But then how will I collect all that sweet sweet easy Karma if I can't post stating every parked car is ICE? ⏤ by *Blacktransjanny* (↑ -8/ ↓ 0)
├─ Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. Your general message is not wrong. Every other post here is an echo chamber of the same thing just written different or by a different outlet. It looks more like karma farming than anything useful. 

This is the first post with useful info that should prob be pinned for those folks who want to take some sort of action. ⏤ by *zerofalks* (↑ -1/ ↓ 0)
├── Reddit changed so badly since 2016 and especially after 2020 for subs like this where there were straight up riots. The average American just wants to be left alone and to have a good economic future, they don't care about alternative lifestyles. But when you try to force those as the primary discussion they won't be interested and won't go out to advocate for your politicians. Instead of self reflecting too many threads pretend like they're in the right and everyone else is an idiot.

  
I don't support the rounding up of random citizens (let's be real we all know who ICE is targeting) but pretending like cities like Chicago and Los Angeles didn't bring this upon themselves is just denial. I would happily welcome a taco truck on every corner (and without DOX'ing myself I kinda already do patronize one). Running around with Latin American flags isn't going to help the cause in this, waving American flags and loudly stating you want to enrich the country with your own flair of culture will.

  
Why is strong borders with a simplified/streamlined immigration process such as controversy for both sides? America succeeds by basically importing everyone else's talent and capitalizing on it, I see no reason to change our winning formula. If that means taco trucks, falafel stands, or cocoanut bread deserts on every corner then damnit let's do it (waistlines be damned).

Out of Chicago’s 147,899 reported crimes since January 1, arrests have been made in just 16.2% of them.

More illegal guns are recovered in Chicago than in New York City and Los Angeles combined.

The number of reported motor vehicle thefts last year was more than double the number in 2021. ⏤ by *ThoughtFormal8488* (↑ -3/ ↓ 0)
├─── Wrong. Chicago has the lowest crime rate in the nation. It also has the lowest crime rate in 30 years. It has 1/4 the murder rate of Ft Worth, Tx and 1/5 the misdemeanor rate of Indianapolis. The reported crimes are just padded numbers to keep our police budget healthy. You can just go on chicagopolice.org and report anything. But most of all we have the highest happiness index in the US. ⏤ by *Zeplar* (↑ -2/ ↓ 0)

As for other alternatives, you won't get the full traffic report like Google does, but OsmAnd does hourly updates, which is reasonable enough and has a very reasonable pricing model. If you just want an offline app that's fully Free Open-Source Software, then Organic Maps will fit the bill.

├─ [deleted] ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├── From the ACLU (which really does not clear up much but does reference the port of entry concept (which would include 9 locations in Illinois)):

&amp;nbsp;


Legally, the 100-mile-wide region is called the “extended border” of the U.S., as defined by Title 8 of the Federal Code of Regulations. There is also something called the “functional equivalent” border, which is the area around international airports in the interior region of the U.S.

&amp;nbsp;


The DHS ruling from last Friday said its “warrantless searches” applied to the U.S. “border and its functional equivalent,” with no mention of the extended 100-mile border.

&amp;nbsp;

Two analysis papers from the Congressional Research Service from 2009 offer some legal insight into what tactics agents can follow within the 100-mile-wide extended border, and why the distinction between the extended border and the other two borders is important.

&amp;nbsp;

Searches within the 100-mile extended border zone, and outside of the immediate border-stop location, must meet three criteria: a person must have recently crossed a border; an agent should know that the object of a search hasn’t changed; and that “reasonable suspicion” of a criminal activity must exist, says the CRS. (The service had done the legal analyses to prepare Congress members for legislation.)

├── "Border searches may also be conducted within the interior of the United States.  The border search exception extends to those searches conducted at the “functional equivalent” of the border. The “functional equivalent” of a border is generally the first practical detention point after a border crossing or the final port of entry."


So port of entry for someone say, flying a direct flight into Utah or Chicago will have a port of entry at an interior border such as customs.  Or someone coming into chicago via the great lakes channel and not docking until chicago. 

Chicago itself has multiple ports of entry.  (several airports + docks)  This are all defined as functionally equivalent to a border.
  Then toss in the supreme court ruling about 100 miles within a border and all of a sudden you have a lot more coverage than simply 100 miles from our exterior border.  


anyway, it's under something called "Functionally equivalent".

Love the dissenting opinion below, I share it entirely:

&gt;I do not dispute the immense social cost caused by drunken drivers, nor do I slight the government's efforts to prevent such tragic losses. Indeed, I would hazard a guess that today's opinion will be received favorably by a majority of our society, who would willingly suffer the minimal intrusion of a sobriety checkpoint stop in order to prevent drunken driving. But consensus that a particular law enforcement technique serves a laudable purpose has never been the touchstone of constitutional analysis.

&gt;In the face of the "momentary evil" of drunken driving, the Court today abdicates its role as the protector of that fundamental right. I respectfully dissent

├── From the ACLU (which really does not clear up much but does reference the port of entry concept (which would include 9 locations in Illinois)):

&amp;nbsp;


Legally, the 100-mile-wide region is called the “extended border” of the U.S., as defined by Title 8 of the Federal Code of Regulations. There is also something called the “functional equivalent” border, which is the area around international airports in the interior region of the U.S.

&amp;nbsp;


The DHS ruling from last Friday said its “warrantless searches” applied to the U.S. “border and its functional equivalent,” with no mention of the extended 100-mile border.

&amp;nbsp;

Two analysis papers from the Congressional Research Service from 2009 offer some legal insight into what tactics agents can follow within the 100-mile-wide extended border, and why the distinction between the extended border and the other two borders is important.

&amp;nbsp;

Searches within the 100-mile extended border zone, and outside of the immediate border-stop location, must meet three criteria: a person must have recently crossed a border; an agent should know that the object of a search hasn’t changed; and that “reasonable suspicion” of a criminal activity must exist, says the CRS. (The service had done the legal analyses to prepare Congress members for legislation.)

The “functional equivalent” of a border is generally the first practical detention point after a border crossing or the final port of entry."


So port of entry for someone say, flying a direct flight into Utah or Chicago will have a port of entry at an interior border such as customs.  Or someone coming into chicago via the great lakes channel and not docking until chicago. 

Chicago itself has multiple ports of entry.  (several airports + docks)  This are all defined as functionally equivalent to a border.
  Then toss in the supreme court ruling about 100 miles within a border and all of a sudden you have a lot more coverage than simply 100 miles from our exterior border.  


anyway, it's under something called "Functionally equivalent".

├── From the ACLU (which really does not clear up much but does reference the port of entry concept (which would include 9 locations in Illinois)):

&amp;nbsp;


Legally, the 100-mile-wide region is called the “extended border” of the U.S., as defined by Title 8 of the Federal Code of Regulations. There is also something called the “functional equivalent” border, which is the area around international airports in the interior region of the U.S.

&amp;nbsp;


The DHS ruling from last Friday said its “warrantless searches” applied to the U.S. “border and its functional equivalent,” with no mention of the extended 100-mile border.

&amp;nbsp;

Two analysis papers from the Congressional Research Service from 2009 offer some legal insight into what tactics agents can follow within the 100-mile-wide extended border, and why the distinction between the extended border and the other two borders is important.

&amp;nbsp;

Searches within the 100-mile extended border zone, and outside of the immediate border-stop location, must meet three criteria: a person must have recently crossed a border; an agent should know that the object of a search hasn’t changed; and that “reasonable suspicion” of a criminal activity must exist, says the CRS. (The service had done the legal analyses to prepare Congress members for legislation.)

├── "Border searches may also be conducted within the interior of the United States.  The border search exception extends to those searches conducted at the “functional equivalent” of the border. The “functional equivalent” of a border is generally the first practical detention point after a border crossing or the final port of entry."


So port of entry for someone say, flying a direct flight into Utah or Chicago will have a port of entry at an interior border such as customs.  Or someone coming into chicago via the great lakes channel and not docking until chicago. 

Chicago itself has multiple ports of entry.  (several airports + docks)  This are all defined as functionally equivalent to a border.
  Then toss in the supreme court ruling about 100 miles within a border and all of a sudden you have a lot more coverage than simply 100 miles from our exterior border.  


anyway, it's under something called "Functionally equivalent".

# Why does O’hare have cannabis amnesty boxes PAST security?

Sorry if this has been asked here before, but I always see those big green “Cannabis Amnesty” boxes at O’hare once you’ve gotten past security.  

I think it would make sense to have them before going through security since cannabis may be illegal in the state you are traveling to.  

Instead having them upon arrival almost implies cannabis is illegal in Chicago.  Who would anyone fly in from another state with cannabis and then get rid of it upon arrival??

I thought maybe it was a federal thing but the boxes say “City of Chicago.”

Just curious if anyone has any insight why it’s done this way

├── If you’re flying out of a legal state, you’re totally fine. TSA’s stated procedure is to refer drug issues to the local police, and in a legal state there’s nothing the local police can do about it. 

Note: that’s a technically their stated policy, they can break that and do something else without notice since it is federally illegal, but at least with a Democratic president I would t guess they’ll be changing that policy randomly anytime soon ⏤ by *camelCaseCoffeeTable* (↑ 18/ ↓ 0)

├─── Ok, so basically it is still illegal, but whether or not the airports/airlines care is debatable.  

Seems like there should be a way to bring items from one state to another if it is legal in both states, but my guess is that nothing like that would happen unless it became federally legal. ⏤ by *vladtheinhaler0* (↑ 4/ ↓ 0)
├──── i do know that certain airport administrations like LAX have publicly stated that they're not looking for or going to confiscate your weed

so as a generally anxious person LAX is the only airport i've ever flown out of with weed ⏤ by *mickcube* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├───── You just gotta accept that the worst case scenario is you lose some weed. That's it...and that's close to a 0% chance of even happening. You always have the excuse "I forgot that was in there", but you'll never be detained unless there's suspicion you're trafficking quantity. 

Alaska/California/Washington/Illinois/Colorado/New York/Maine/Massachusetts/Georgia/Tennessee...all states I've flown in/out of with weed. Usually just a pack of edibles, sometimes with a joint or two, occasionally with a cart or eighth. After the first time or two, it feels normal, eventually you do it accidentally. 

Been randomly searched, weed seen (open toiletries bag), didn't matter... ⏤ by *take_care_a_ya_shooz* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
├──── Federal laws apply to airspace, so state laws for pretty much anything while you're in the sky are moot.

Practically speaking, you have nothing to worry about when flying with weed from legal/illegal to the other. The likelihood of you getting busted with a personal stash and getting detained is close to zero. So while it should be legal, anybody who would otherwise fly with weed but are worried about the feds is just being paranoid. 

Nobody is going to be waiting for you at the gate. What you do with the weed at your destination is all that matters. ⏤ by *take_care_a_ya_shooz* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├───── Thank you for the response. I suppose then, if you were to make it through TSA you are pretty much good, especially flying from a state where it is legal. I am sure there are some states you don't play around in. ⏤ by *vladtheinhaler0* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

├─ I’m pretty sure it’s a crime to be anywhere in an airport with weed since airports are under federal laws. Could be totally wrong on that, but I’m fairly sure that’s the case. ⏤ by *camelCaseCoffeeTable* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
├── Not so, or at least not especially so in the case of airports. 

Airports are governed by state and local laws. Federal laws and jurisdiction apply, but only to the same extent they would apply in any neighborhood or town in the state. Which, in this case, could theoretically lead to FDA or DEA involvement, but hopefully we’ve seen the end of that when it comes to dime bags of weed.  

A common misconception about airports and federal law, because of the presence of federal agencies such as TSA and CBP. But those agencies have very specific powers in airports, which is likely part of the reason you would in the past see TSA notices about “if we catch you with X, we’ll turn you over to local authorities,” rather than making the arrest themselves. Plus, the presence or absence of arresting power and which personnel count as law enforcement… and all the in the weeds details that follow. ⏤ by *MCRNRocinante* (↑ 7/ ↓ 0)
├─── It is absolutely a federal crime to possess weed in an airport (and anywhere in the  US). It, however, is not enforced due to the decision by the DOJ not to prioritize cannabis prosecution in legal states (previously backed by the Cole memo). ⏤ by *roloplex* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├──── Correct. In an airport or anywhere in the US. Hence  the second sentence in my comment pointing out that the federal laws and jurisdiction in the airport is the same as in any neighborhood or town in the state. 

And I already pointed out the federal government (via DEA or FDA) could become involved, and also acknowledged it’s not likely.

##### Technically it's illegal to fly with, but legal to have on the ground. I read in Denver only like 5 people over several years were arrested. They were carrying more than legally allowed.

I also read the worst that will happen is they pull a cop over to confirm you are 21 or older to legally be allowed in possession of it. Cops don't have jurisdiction over the air.

├─ TSAs main directive is not to stop drug smuggling across state lines.  Their directive is to keep airplanes safe for passengers.

TSAs guidelines on if they find an illegal substance  that is not a threat to other passengers safety is to turn it over to local law enforcement.

In the states where weed is legal you being in the airport with weed is not illegal so the local police will likely not doing anything with you as long as you don’t have more than the legally allowed amount.

Thus it’s a waste of time for tsa to call you out in legal states.

Now if you hop on a plane the second you enter the sky you’re under federal jurisdiction, so you’re breaking the law only after the plane takes off.

So you’ll likely get through security with edibles fine but let’s say you break another law or draw major attention to yourself while on the plane and they find it you may get the weed tacked on to whatever federal offense you’re getting charged ⏤ by *heythosearemysocks* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

##### Tourism will get hit in 2025. Definitely international tourism, likely domestic as well. 

The good news is Illinois/Chicago doesn’t rely that heavily on international tourism. Less than 4% of visitors are international, they may make up a slightly bigger percent of the revenue spent but even if they are spending double on average (8% of revenue) and we lose half of them. That’s still only losing ~4% of revenue.



Compared to say Vegas where ~12% of traveler are international or NYC with ~20%, Chicago’s tourism will fair better as our countries international tourism drops due to completely avoidable nonsense from the White House.

Wrigley will always be here, people will get hyped out the Bears, and the Bulls will still be a massive international brand ⏤ by *LegacyLemur* (↑ 17/ ↓ 0)
├─ I do wonder if tourism will start to be taken from red states and funneled into blue states. I mean why would an international tourist visit Florida or Texas where they might get harassed by border patrol when they could come to NY, Chicago, or LA where there’s at least some protection. ⏤ by *Chlorinated_beverage* (↑ 14/ ↓ 0)
├── Customs and Border Patrol agents exist at Chicago airports too. You can’t avoid them coming into the country even in blue states. Same for ICE or other federal agents patrolling Chicago or LA streets.


“Fun” fact, Border Patrol doesn’t need warrants to search vehicles within 100 miles of a border.

Their families come to visit them from overseas too. Dependents come with them and contribute dollars to the local economy.

# Is the Illinois International Port District affected by the ILA strike?

Obviously it will become affected as international shipping services react to the backup, but are longshoremen in the Illinois International Port District part of the ILA? Are they striking now? I have no idea how any of this works but am curious; I'd love it if anyone could offer an overview.

##### The ILA is currently striking against the United States Maritime Alliance, which the Illinois International Port District is not a part of. Therefore Chicago area ports shouldn't be directly impacted by the strike, although the supply chain disruptions of a long strike will have some ripple impacts. The Illinois International Port District is part of the American Great Lakes Ports Association. I couldn't find any information on when that contract expired. ⏤ by *PhileasFoggsTrvlAgt* (↑ 43/ ↓ 0)
##### Whether it's affected or not. Toilet paper and water bottles are MADE IN AMERICA, no need to panic buy and hoard these items! ⏤ by *Solo_is_dead* (↑ 27/ ↓ 0)
├─ Also the municipal water district isn’t on strike so you shouldn’t be buying water bottles anyway ⏤ by *Lost_Bike69* (↑ 29/ ↓ 0)
├─ 100%. The only products we're going to see a semi immediate effect on are things with no shelf life, or more specialty goods that come through the east coast. Think things like certain fresh fruits, and imported beer, wine, and cheese, etc.. For stuff like TP, canned goods, bottled water, frozen meat and veggies, there are warehouses chock full of that stuff. When you buy a bag of frozen peas or a can of black beans at Jewel, those vegetables weren't harvested the week before. If they were grown in another country and came through our ports, they've been sitting in a warehouse outside of a major city on the east coast for weeks or months, and Jewel negotiates when they get that product from the distributor. If the strike continues for another ~month+ it'll be a different story, but there is absolutely no need to panic buy right now. 

If it puts your mind at ease to buy three cans of chickpeas instead of two the next time you're at Jewel, go for it! But no one needs to be buying hundreds of rolls of toilet paper. ⏤ by *JejuneBourgeois* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├─ Is bottled water in short supply because of people panicking about the strike or because a huge area of the SE has significant hurricane damage? ⏤ by *PhileasFoggsTrvlAgt* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├── It is a panic situation. This of course creates a wave effect as all of a sudden the whole world fears the loss of toilet paper. To be honest with you, I do too :) ⏤ by *mdoherty1967* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├─ Also, get a bidet. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
├─ Anddd it's over, the strike is over

Wages are settled, dockworkers going back to work, finer details being nailed down still ⏤ by *hascogrande* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
└────

##### Doesn’t matter anymore as the strike is being put on hold until January 15 to give negotiators more time. ⏤ by *TheOnlyVertigo* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
##### Side story...because the Chicago port receives international ships, it is a "Port of Entry" under federal law.  IIRC this gives the Border Patrol division of Homeland Security jurisdiction to conduct sweeps and stop individuals within ??150 miles?? of the port to see if their papers are in order. ⏤ by *PParker46* (↑ 0/ ↓ 0)
├─ Its actually that the Great Lakes are the external boundary of the USA.

##### A couple years ago we did an Illinois stay-cation and rode part of the Illinois section of the Mother Road as the first leg.  We discovered many of the smaller towns along the route have made a focused effort to cater to Route 66 travelers.  --- which is a very big deal to European visitors, BTW.

Along the way, among other interesting stops, we visited the gift shop of the factory that makes the world supply of beer nuts, a nearly untouched Carnegie Library, *the actual grave of the real Mother Jones*,  and Joliet Jake's eponymous temporary government-paid home.

Earlier, my dad and his dad made the full trip when Route 66 first opened.  In 1929 they set out in a 1927 Franklin with three spare tires on the roof and a Greyhound dog for companion.  Four weeks going West.  The pavement became occasional after Missouri.  They rested a week on an Arizona Indian reservation.

During our staycation ~~c75~~ *c85* years later I drove on some of the same original brick paving.  That was an incredible feeling. ⏤ by *PParker46* (↑ 29/ ↓ 0)
├─ I bicycled a few stretches of the old Route 66 about 10 years ago.  Went over the Chain of Rocks bridge north of St. Louis, saw the grave of Mother Jones, and cycled over the stretch of brick road north of Auburn, Illinois that is maintained by the National Park Service.  There are some segments of road that kind of remain alongside I-55 between Springfield and St. Louis that are no longer in use as a road, but haven't completely deteriorated.  The grasses and weeds growing up from between the cracks, though, made cycling those portions very difficult. ⏤ by *kinbakudude* (↑ 7/ ↓ 0)
├─ A Franklin, you say? I know a guy from Michigan who crossed the country a few years ago in a 1919 Franklin that his family had owned since new. His great uncle had also taken it west in the 1920s. Guess air-cooled was just the way to go. 

Route 66 is great and despite all of its kitsch and tourist absurdity, it’s an amazing way to see the country. Everyone should do it once just to see places like Oatman and Amboy (CA) and Gallup. ⏤ by *JermaineDyeAtSS* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
├─ Family footnote...while in Los Angeles my dad, unaware at the time in 1929, walked the same streets as my mother did when she briefly lived in Los Angeles in 1917/19 before the Spanish Flu epidemic orphaned her and she was returned to Chicago.  

Covid aspect...her mother went from feeling normal to dead in three days.  Get vaccinated, mask, distance, and wash...if not for you, for the sake of your descendants.  **Please.  It is a gap that can not be filled.**  Now, more than 100 years later, it still hurts. ⏤ by *PParker46* (↑ 14/ ↓ 0)

# Getting Illinois License Plates

I moved here from California back in March and my CA car registration has now expired. I'm interested in switching my registration to my new Illinois address and getting plates, but I have a few questions:

1) On the Illinois DMV website, they refer to Title **and** Plates quite a bit. What exactly is title? I already have my car's pink slip handy, so do I also need to get Illinois Title or just Plates?

2) How much does it cost to switch registration over to Illinois?

3) Do I need an Illinois driver's license to register my car in Illinois? My CA issued license doesn't expire for several years, so I'd like to avoid the hassle of getting one in IL.

4) I've been using an IPass daily in my car for a few months now that is, of course, registered to my CA plates; any info on changing this? Do I need to buy and register a new IPass?

Appreciate the help, folks. Thanks!

##### Don't buy a new I-Pass, log into your account online. If you didn't make one you still can. Add the vehicle twice with your CA plates and future IL plates(when you get them). You will be fine. ⏤ by *Demander850* (↑ 4/ ↓ 0)
##### I just did this about a month ago. 

1. It's the "pink slip;" the proof of ownership. Like [this](http://www.donateacar2charity.com/images/uploads/title_california.jpg)

2. It wasn't a whole lot, but you'll need to also buy plates when you do it. They don't take debit cards only cash or credit. Lots of info [here](http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/services/new_residents.html). I think under $200 for everything.

3. I think you're required to get a new liscence as your permanent residence has changed. WATCH OUT. YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE WRITTEN TEST!!!

4. I'm not sure about the Ipass, but they said my city sticker was fine with my old plate number.

# Getting Illinois License Plates

I moved here from California back in March and my CA car registration has now expired. I'm interested in switching my registration to my new Illinois address and getting plates, but I have a few questions:

1) On the Illinois DMV website, they refer to Title **and** Plates quite a bit. What exactly is title? I already have my car's pink slip handy, so do I also need to get Illinois Title or just Plates?

2) How much does it cost to switch registration over to Illinois?

3) Do I need an Illinois driver's license to register my car in Illinois? My CA issued license doesn't expire for several years, so I'd like to avoid the hassle of getting one in IL.

4) I've been using an IPass daily in my car for a few months now that is, of course, registered to my CA plates; any info on changing this? Do I need to buy and register a new IPass?

Appreciate the help, folks. Thanks!

##### Don't buy a new I-Pass, log into your account online. If you didn't make one you still can. Add the vehicle twice with your CA plates and future IL plates(when you get them). You will be fine. ⏤ by *Demander850* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

# Daily ICE Spotting

This thread is for **consolidating ICE spottings and activity** **each day** in one location.

Only posts that are primarily about spotting are strongly recommended to be here. This way someone who is moving about the city and is primarily concerned with encountering ICE does not need to sort through the entire sub. **ICE information can continue as posts of their own. Please use the ICE flair for such posts.** 

Please follow these guidelines:

* Reserve top-level comments for new events, sightings, or information
   * All comments related to the same topic then go beneath that comment
* Make sure you check existing comments before posting, to avoid cluttering the top-level with redundant information
* This is a difficult time and emotions run high, but please remember that anything that incites or threatens violence may result in a ban, and may also violate Reddit rules

Do your best to fill in as many of the SALUTE rules for reporting as you can:

* **SIZE**: Include the number of individuals, vehicles, or assets present in the observed area.
* **ACTIVITY**: Describe the actions and behavior of the observed group/individuals.
* **LOCATION**: Provide precise detailed description of the activity’s location.
* **UNIFORM**: Identify the affiliation or group to which the observed entity belongs.
* **TIME**: Record the date and time of the observation.
* **EQUIPMENT**: List the equipment, weaponry, or tools associated with the observed group

Resources (please note that these are not in our control and are largely unverified, so use with some caution):

* Crowd-sourced map of ICE activity: [https://iceout.org/en/](https://iceout.org/en/)
* Local journalists verifying video of ICE activity (see comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1nyk9z9/comment/nhwrtvf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)): [https://callforvideos.formstack.com/forms/chicagojournalists](https://callforvideos.formstack.com/forms/chicagojournalists)
* This sub is about tracking ICE behavior beyond Chicago: r/EyesOnIce

Finally, please include official sources in your comments if you can (e.g. news article links).  Everyone stay safe out there.

# 15-Year-Old U.S. Citizen Taken By Feds For 5 Hours After East Side Protest, Attorney Says

“In the commotion the 15-year-old boy, a Black and Hispanic U.S. citizen, was slammed to the ground, kneed in the back and zip-tied by Border Patrol agents, attorneys from the Romanucci and Blandin law firm said in a statement.

The boy was taken to a federal facility and handcuffed inside a car in a garage for five hours, according to the attorneys. He was never booked, read his rights or allowed to contact his mother, who had “no idea where her son was or whether he [was] safe,” according to the attorneys.”

├──── I think you are underestimating how isolating the media bubbles can be. Trump has said an absolute ton of wild things, flood the zone and all that. Unless you are very engaged, it’s so easy to miss something or for your media bubble to simply never cover it or to write it off as another crazy Trump thing that’s being overblown.

And setting aside formal education, anyone nowadays can search YouTube to find one topic they're interested in learning more about.

That being said I hate Trump and think people need to educate themselves. But it doesn’t make every single person who voted for him the worst. Especially when they acknowledge it now and regret it.

# ICE using two different state license plates ?

I was on my way to work this morning when I saw a silver gray F-150 with tinted windows pull up behind me. There was traffic in my lane, so they switched lanes and got in front of me. That’s when I noticed they had Texas plates on the back and Illinois plates in the back. 

This was today, on Ashland in the Back of the Yards neighborhood

Anybody else seen this? Is this not illegal?

##### You think they care about what’s legal? They’ve been [caught switching plates](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/s/TS4aoFhGA6) already and it’s not surprising they are too stupid to switch both the front and back. ⏤ by *Cormano_Wild_219* (↑ 101/ ↓ 0)
├─ &gt;too stupid to switch both the front and back.

Or maybe didn't notice they'd pulled an unmatched set from the bin? Or hadn't been able to buy/confiscate/steal both plates off a random car?  

This could be an honest working problem for them if they've primarily  recruited mouth breathers from the back woods of states with just one plate.  As happens to many who don't get out much they might assume their limited awareness of the world is complete.  But in the end I'll go with they just don't want to be held accountable and the policy up the line is to see that as an honorable feature. ⏤ by *PParker46* (↑ 15/ ↓ 0)

# Wouldnt ultimate hack against ICE just be wearing their own uniforms or everyone wearing mask and same outfit?

Thinking of it like a video game, if ice hides their face and they dont need any form of ID then why cant we do the same. At that point they cant really target people or if everyone wore ghostface mask everywhere same logic would apply. At that point they would be blind targetting and I feel like that would be good lawsuit to fight. Obviously this requires teamwork but maybe effective tactic if everyone agreed to do it

├────── And *why* is the general public armed? Because an oppressive police state is armed against them. 

It's a pandora's box of mutually-assured destruction that began the day our founding fathers included gun ownership as the second constitutional right to our nation. Overturning 2A would be an arguably impossible task. So if guns can't go away, you'd better be armed, because you can bet your ass the fascists will be. It's the same underlying principle that lead to every developed nation (and then some) in the world harboring nuclear warheads, and why nuclear disarmament efforts have been futile. ⏤ by *connorgrs* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)
├─────── I get the theory, but it seems like practically every other developed country has done fine without arming their citizens. Many countries maintain healthy democracies even without "mutually assured destruction" of citizens vs agents of the government. 

And if you look at SWAT or counter terrorism police units they are just as militarized tbh. It's just the low level beat cops who are unarmed, the state still can (and often does) use highly armed law enforcement on their people. ⏤ by *fidgey10* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├──────── Yes, Australia and other nations that have completely outlawed guns have much lower gun violence stats. But no other country has gun rights enshrined in the foundation of their nation, something we have that is virtually impossible to get rid of.

├── This is the problem with IL gun laws.  You show up with a gun, and they will instantly detain you as a threat.  ARs are generally illegal (Cook County has an AR ban, and the state has PICA - so in Broadview, ARs can be legal in certain circumstances - if you owned them pre-PICA, but welcome to the nuances of gun laws), as is open carry.  If you show up open carrying an AR, they will see you as an immediate threat, and potentially even use lethal force, even if youre not aiming at them.

If we respected the Second Amendment, then carrying guns would be normalized, and the power would be more balanced in situations like this.  Pritzker needs to sign an EO legalizing open carry of ARs "to allow citizens to protect themselves in the face of violence" or something, but he would NEVER.  The funny thing is, the right would be totally split over a move like this, because they would hate it, but also couldnt villify expansion of 2nd amendment rights.

Absolutely, we have a lot to learn as far as protesting goes. Yes, people should be covering their faces for the time when the thought police start tracking you down after the fact. If you're going to be doing illegal shit to provoke them then yes, you'd want to blend in (as far as I know, which is little). Look at what Portland is doing with the animal costumes, which is obviously to mock and point out the absurdity of saying it's a warzone. 

Personally, as far as optics goes, I like seeing everyday people of all races and ages opposing the fascists. If the protesters were all dressed like ninjas, it would give credence to the idea that Antifa is some actual organization. But right now it shows that normal, everyday Americans are anti-fascism.

Anyone know where to find homemade chai in Chicago? Anyone making the real deal like from scratch with the spices? ⏤ by *SamtastickBombastic* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
├─── It's pretty easy! You can buy good chai masala, we use Kamal tea masala, Badshah brand. I'm not really good at measurements, but roughly 2-3 tsp black chai, 1 tsp-ish (depending on your taste) masala, 1/2 cup water, we add fresh ginger, mint, lemongrass, cinnamon, and cardamom pod, but that's all optional. Boil, once it's boiled about 5 mins, add 1/2 cup milk, boil til it starts to boil over (don't let it, obv. Keep an eye on it once it gets to boiling after adding the milk. Perfection and horrible, burnt mess are milliseconds apart.) Let it get to boil over a couple times (rise, remove from heat, settle, back on heat, rise again, turn off heat). Strain, enjoy!

That's what CEO Trump is mentioning here, who also apparently told him to save Memphis. Oh and just coincidentally is pushing the admin to allow a major merger to go through.

##### What’s insane about all of this to me, is that his supporters genuinely believe that they are only arresting hardened criminals. And that this administration’s mission is to “clean up” the city. In reality they are getting America used to military and government presence where no accountability is present. Where all constitutional rights are being thrown out the window and you are subject to being physically attacked and detained for any situation where the Gestapo says so. 

The MAGAts don’t think this applies to them. And while now, it doesn’t. But as soon as our country is in a full blown civil war, all rules are off. No one will be safe. No one will have any rights.
